# Garmin Running LLM Analysis üèÉ
By: Braveenth Rasanayagam

---

The goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to have reuseable code that facilitates the prompting and analysis of your your Garmin-tracked runs by LLMs.

This was built to help train for a half-marathon, and you can use it for your fitness activities.

I solved the context length limitations imposed by various LLM models by splitting the data using even rows, which is a method to reduce the number of data points. I am also considering other mathematical methods of reducing the number of data points.
